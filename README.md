DO NOT COMMIT SOLUTIONS, BE SURE TO PUT ANSWERS IN `contracts_optimized` to ensure they fall into the `.gitignore`

## Players
Your goal is to optimize the contracts such that they reach the target efficiency.

Rules
- you may not change the optimizer level
- you may not change the solidity version
- you may change function names and refactor functionality as long as you don't break the business logic
- you may make reasonable assumptions about what variable sizes are necessary to get things done
- you may remove unnecessary or redunant logic (some have been intentionally added)
